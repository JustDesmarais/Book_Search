# Book_Search
An app to search and save books to read or buy

## Description

The Book Search is a simple web app that will allow you to search and save all the books that you are interested in buying, borrowing, or reading.  The search is powered by the Google Books API to pull in each book's title, author(s), description, image, and link.  This particular application has been refactored from using a RESTful API via express routing to a GraphQL framework.

The Book Search was built using Apollo Server, Mongoose, Graphql, and React.
